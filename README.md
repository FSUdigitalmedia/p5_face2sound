# p5_face2sound

This is an example of how to have the position of a face in the webcam's view affect sound.

It requires chaitaigne, configured to map websockets messages to udp messages, which are received by the pilot synth application (see the included chataigne .noisette config)

(note that, unlike all of the other p5js code so far, this one gets all of the required 
javascript libraries from the internet, instead of a libraries folder - look at index.html)
